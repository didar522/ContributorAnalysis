Hi @hmallett, this is already covered by #579. To avoid merge conflicts with that PR, I'm not going to merge this one in.
I did look for that in the Rubocop PR commit logs, bit didn't see it!
It was part of the huge 'Autocorrect offenses' commit.
I'm going to merge this in pretty soon if no objections are raised.
I'm assuming no objections ...
@hmallett the Travis build indicates something's wrong with the foreign keys on MySQL and PostgreSQL. Can you take a look?
Ouch! The Travis build is a mess! It worked fine for me using PostgreSQL 9.4 and Ruby 2.2. I think this needs some serious further investigation...
Hi. Have you check your email configuration into Heroku? Since there's no sendmail command by default, you have to get a free addon for it like said here: https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/smtp
(certainly related to #571 )
I'll try it now, thanks.
Looks good. Thanks, @hmallett.
