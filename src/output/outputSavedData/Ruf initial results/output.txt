Hi @hmallett, this is already covered by #579. To avoid merge conflicts with that PR, I'm not going to merge this one in.

I did look for that in the Rubocop PR commit logs, bit didn't see it!
Tue Feb 10 02:46:12 MST 2015
It was part of the huge 'Autocorrect offenses' commit.
Tue Feb 10 03:05:32 MST 2015
I like this. Is there any way we can automate this?
Wed Feb 18 13:08:51 MST 2015
I don't know of one. :(
Wed Feb 25 05:57:25 MST 2015
I'm going to merge this in pretty soon if no objections are raised.
Sun Feb 08 07:59:40 MST 2015
I'm assuming no objections ...

@hmallett the Travis build indicates something's wrong with the foreign keys on MySQL and PostgreSQL. Can you take a look?
Sat Feb 07 14:15:30 MST 2015
Ouch! The Travis build is a mess! It worked fine for me using PostgreSQL 9.4 and Ruby 2.2. I think this needs some serious further investigation...

I have taken the foreign keys out, because (as I understand it) some of the tests currently performed violate foreign key constraints. So for example, a test stubs out an article, but doesn't save it, but then tests if a comment can be saved. With no saved article, the fk constraint is violated.
As far as I can tell, everything works, but without valid tests it's not a forward step to add the foreign keys.
I'll have to look at the tests in more depth... (and learn rspec).

Renamed the PR - let's leave foreign keys alone for a little while!
Sat Feb 28 03:10:52 MST 2015
Seems ok for me. Thanks !

Hi. Have you check your email configuration into Heroku? Since there's no sendmail command by default, you have to get a free addon for it like said here: https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/smtp

(certainly related to #571 )
Thu Feb 05 02:44:37 MST 2015
I'll try it now, thanks.
Thu Feb 05 02:48:17 MST 2015
Looks good. Thanks, @hmallett.
